         <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>I am a UX designer with a background in psychology. I have experience
             in an applied role as a civilian contractor with the army, where I
             designed programs to cultivate well being in wounded soldiers.
             Empathy, creativity, and collaboration led to programatic success.
             To date these programs continue to support soldiers in many forms
             of recovery. I would like to take what I have learned, working with
             a unique population, and apply these lessons in a role as a UX
             designer and strategist where impact can be designed to help other
             populations in need. I would love the opportunity to collaborate,
             or simply toss some ideas around with you and your team. Be sure
             to check out my portfolio and connect with me on LinkedIn.</p>
